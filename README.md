# BlogVi - Tailwind Static Blog with Search (No backend)

# üëã Reason for this Project

I tried to setup a static blog for my company, but I quickly found out that it's really difficult to get a nice looking *free blog with search and comments* without:
1. ‚ùå Paying a monthly Subscription for a SaaS commercial Blog
2. ‚ùå Hosting a search backend/opensource blog
3. ‚ùå Paying for third party search solution

The goal of this project is to be a free static blog:
1.  ‚úÖ That can be hosted on github pages
2.  ‚úÖ That supports search, comments, analytics and custom javascripts out of the box with minimal configuration
3.  ‚úÖ That looks nice and modern and supports beautiful responsive theming with tailwind CSS
4.  ‚úÖ That costs 0 dollars to host and maintain
5.  ‚úÖ Provides it's administrator with a simple workflow to create, approve and publish blog posts from other contributors
6.  ‚úÖ Provides me with a fun side project to contirbute to in my spare time
