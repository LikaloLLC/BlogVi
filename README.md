# BlogVi - Tailwind Static Blog with Search (No backend)

# 👋 Reason for this Project

I tried to setup a static blog for my company, but I quickly found out that it's really difficult to get a nice looking *free blog with search and comments* without:
1. ❌ Paying a monthly Subscription for a SaaS commercial Blog
2. ❌ Hosting a search backend/opensource blog
3. ❌ Paying for third party search solution

The goal of this project is to be a free static blog:
1.  ✅ That can be hosted on github pages
2.  ✅ That supports search, comments, analytics and custom javascripts out of the box with minimal configuration
3.  ✅ That looks nice and modern and supports beautiful responsive theming with tailwind CSS
4.  ✅ That costs 0 dollars to host and maintain
5.  ✅ Provides it's administrator with a simple workflow to create, approve and publish blog posts from other contributors
6.  ✅ Provides me with a fun side project to contirbute to in my spare time
